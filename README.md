# Trivial-Game

This is a course project for C++ programming, a very simple re-creation of SimCity, a famous and top-level city-building game. All codes are only for project usage and no commercial interest is involved.

This project uses FLTK as its GUI designing tool, download it here: https://www.fltk.org/software.php. To be able to run the game in your local system, don't forget to complete all installation procedures, including copying FLTK files to the game directory and adding them to the solution file (if you're using Visual Studio), to ensure that the game can compile successfully.

The four-member group was set up on 14th December 2018 and conception of the project instantly initiated. The project formally started on 24th December 2018 and was suspended on 17th January 2019, the date on which we submitted the codes and did our presentation. Until now, there're still loads of bugs (major and minor, discovered and un-discovered). If you're interested in helping this project to become better, you're welcome to create pull requests.
